# Class-Activation-Maps
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for visualizing Class Activation Maps (CAM) using a trained deep learning model. CAMs identify key regions in an image that influence the model's classification decision. Highlighting these regions provides insights into the model's behavior, aiding in interpretability and debugging.
